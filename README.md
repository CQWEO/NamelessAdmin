# NamelessAdmin
Nameless Admin is an open-source admin script that was made by 0866, but now is modified by qipu. 
Here is the original UI https://v3rmillion.net/showthread.php?tid=908022 
The command bar is not supported on mobile so its recommended for you to use a pc.
For the tool commands, your executor needs to have firetouchinterests supported for them to work.
I recommend getting Synapse X since every single command will be supported on it.
